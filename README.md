# Multiple_Comparisons

This is a playground file to play with a two-sided test of means in both a Bayesian context and a frequentist context in high dimensional settings. Goal is to see how the dimension modifies the outputs of the test with a fixed number of samples across each dimension.

It was also a goal to set up and configure Xcode on my new laptop.
